This directory contains the formalization of Stalmarck's algorithm.


It is composed of :

-  a proof of correctness of the algorithm as described in 
    `A formalization of Stalmarck's algorithm in COQ' TPHOLs2000.

- an implementation of the algorithm. With respect to the paper,
  this implementation is completely functional and can be used inside
  Coq.

- a reflected tactic Stalt, that uses the extracted code to compute
  an execution trace, the trace checker is then called inside Coq.


To build the directory, do

  coq_makefile *.v staltac.ml > Makefile

Then

  make depend;make all
  
See algoRun.v for examples how to use stalmarck inside Coq

See StalTac_ex.v for examples how to use the reflected tactic.
